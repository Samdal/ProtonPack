# Ghostbusters Proton pack
Me and a friend are making a proton pack from the movie ghostbusters.
In order to controll all the switches, lights and sounds we decided upon using an ATmega2560 would be easy and cheap. 

I am using PlatformIO in this project.
`platform: atmelavr; board: megaatmega2560; framework: arduino`

If you want more information on how it works. Contact me on Discord at DRAVA#8380
